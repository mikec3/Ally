1. Be Aware Who are you? Understanding your viewpoint and its origins in maleness or femaleness, religion, ethnicity, race, physical and emotional abilities, class, etc., is critical to understanding your relationship to others, to ideas, and to events. 
</p>
<p>
2. Educate Yourself Learning about others is the next important step in becoming an ally. Challenge yourself to learn about persons, cultures, and groups that you do not identify with. It is only by learning about others that you can stand with and for them in the face of oppression. The knowledge you gain will enable you to be accountable to the persons for whom you are an ally.
</p>
<p>
3. Gain the Skills In order to be an effective ally, you need to develop skills to communicate the knowledge you have gained about yourself and others. This may seem frightening at first, since it involves taking steps towards action. Research venues where you can practice the skills needed to become an ally in a safe, non-judgmental environment. 
</p>
<p>
4.  Take Action It is only by participation that we become involved in the struggle to end oppression in our communities. Yes, it is challenging. Yes, it can be frightening. However, if we keep our knowledge, thoughts, skills, and awareness to ourselves, we deprive others not only of our own gifts, but of a life of richness and equality. Share your knowledge.
